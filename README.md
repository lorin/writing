Writing is hard. Here are a few resources to help.

## Videos

[The craft of writing effectively][1] by Larry McEnerney is a fantastic talk by the Director of the University of Chicago's Writing Program. One thing that has always stuck with me about this talk is the idea that writing has two purposes:

* to help you clarify your thoughts
* to communicate effectively to your audience

Confusing those two purposes will get you into trouble.


## Papers

[State the problem before describing the solution][2] by Leslie Lamport is a very short (<1 page) paper with advice on how to write a computer science paper. 


## Books

[Storycraft][3] by Jack Hart is great advice on writing narrative long-form journalism.
